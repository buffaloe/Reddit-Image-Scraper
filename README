Reddit Image Scraper is a perl script designed to read in one or more
subreddits and download all the images in it that are hosted on the
imgur.com image hosting site. Be aware that this script can chew 
through bandwidth quickly, especially if given a large list of
subreddits. Please be curtious of the bandwidth of both reddit.com
and imgur.com. Let's keep these two free resouces just that: free.
